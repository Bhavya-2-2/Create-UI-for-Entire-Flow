1. Low-Level Design (LLD)
The LLD will describe the components of the system and their interactions in detail.

Detailed Description of Each Component
User Service: Manages user-related operations such as signup, login, user updates, etc.
Discussion Service: Handles creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval of discussions.
Comment Service: Manages comments on discussions, including creation, updating, and deletion.
Like Service: Handles liking functionality for discussions and comments.
Search Service: Facilitates searching for users and discussions based on criteria.

 (This is a placeholder, the actual diagram will be created as part of the implementation)

2. System Architecture and Microservices
We'll break down the system into microservices:

User Service
Discussion Service
Comment Service
Like Service
Search Service
Auth Service (for login and signup)
3. Database Schema
We'll use SQL for our database. Below are the table definitions and relationships:

Users (user_id, name, mobile_no, email, password)
Discussions (discussion_id, user_id, text, image, created_on, view_count)
Hashtags (hashtag_id, tag)
DiscussionHashtags (discussion_id, hashtag_id)
Comments (comment_id, discussion_id, user_id, text, created_on)
Likes (like_id, user_id, discussion_id, comment_id)
Followers (follower_id, user_id, followed_user_id)
4. API Design and Documentation
We'll use Flask for creating the API endpoints.

Update User: PUT /users/{user_id}
Delete User: DELETE /users/{user_id}
